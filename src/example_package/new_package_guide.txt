To create new package:

1. Create  package folder in ./src with corresponding name. Example package could me taken as a template.
    Package should contain files:
        __init__.py - empty
        view.py with View class extends common.Extention_package_base_classes.BaseView
        model.py with Model class extending common..Extention_package_base_classes.BaseModel
        controller.py - extends common..Extention_package_base_classes.BaseController
        main.py - containing Run function which creates new package controller.

2. View and Model and Controller are extentions of corresponding inheriting base classes.
    To create new widget need to create new class in view.py and add it to the view object in the Controller constructor.
    To create new model need to create new class in model.py and add it to the model object in the Controller constructor.
    Call constructor of the base_controller class with view and model objects.
    Bind function in controller may be overridden for new funcitonality.
3. In main.py in the package update imported Controller
4. Add new package to the package list in packages.conf file in the root of project.

5. Package should be automatically added under module menu in main app during runtime.
